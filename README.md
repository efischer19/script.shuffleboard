# shuffleboard

## A Kodi plugin for my home media center.

### Pre-v1 progress and plans:
* v0.0.1 (done)
  * finds all happy endings episodes
  * shuffles that list, and queues them all

* v0.0.2 (in-progress)
  * add repeat "ON"
  * use config file to define show (still just one for now)
  * clean up repo for easy download-n-installing

* v0.0.3 
    * same net effect, but clean up code to use multiple classes, be "clean", add unit tests, etc

* v0.0.4 and beyond
    * multiple shows in config, flip between them.
    * able to configure shows used in options menu rather than pre-defined text file

Might consider cutting v1.0 release at this point, we'll see.

### Future considerations:
* specify in-order vs random
* show upcoming schedule somehow
* allow for "N episode chunks"
* mix shows if desired
* resume/return to where last watching
* more features? I'll add thigns as I think of them
