# shuffleboard

A Kodi plugin for my home media center.

First goal:
    -be able to define a subset of my TV shows to be included in the addon
    -play a never-ending "shuffle all" loop of these shows
    -flip between the shows via up/down arrows while playing

Further functionality to be added incrementally after that is working.
